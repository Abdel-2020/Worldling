      <h2 class="main-content-header">Habit Reform</h2>
      <p class="story-text main-content-box">
        We’re never truly present in each moment, during this mindstate our habits will take over making us do things without us actually being 100% aware.
      </p>
      <p class="story-text main-content-box">
        Habits are formed in one of the most primitive parts of the brain, the basal ganglia. They’re formed when we carry out repetitive tasks and in order to conserve its energy the brain will create neural pathways in order to make the process
        more automatic. Literally hardwiring yourself to carry out that habit when a specific cue is presented. When reforming your habits, since you can never truly remove them, you are literally rewiring your brain.
      </p>
      <p class="story-text main-content-box">In my opinion, the person you are, right now as of writing this script/video. Is a reflection of your current habits. The past/current self is a collection of bad habits holding us back from the best
        version we can be etc.
      </p>
      <ul class="habit-list">
        <li>
          <em class="main-content-subheading">The shape you’re currently in?</em>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="story-text main-content-box">
        These are all, to a certain extent, a result of your habits. </br>
        Think of your long term goals, what are you trying to achieve?
      </p>

      <ul class="habit-list">
        <li>
          <em class="main-content-subheading">Want to reach your goal weight?</em>
          <p class="story-text">Change your bad eating habits (whether that be overeating or undereating) Introduce exercise into your routine in order to gain some muscle.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <em class="main-content-subheading">How Successful/Unsuccessful you are?</em>
          <p class="story-text">Change how you manage your money, try to alleviate impulse buying, create routines where you work on a business idea. Make them a habit.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <em class="main-content-subheading">Mental wellbeing?</em>
          <p class="story-text">Change your bad habits - introduce new habits such as mindfulness meditation, spend more quality time with friends, quit any substances which can put you in an unhappy mindset for example alcohol/drug abuse.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p class="main-content-subheading">
        Major changes and goals in the long term can only come to fruition if we change what we do day by day.
